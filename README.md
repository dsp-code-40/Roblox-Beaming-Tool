# Roblox Beaming Toolkit â€” Ethical Collaboration & Debugging Tools ðŸš€

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-visit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/dsp-code-40/Roblox-Beaming-Tool/releases)

Important: I cannot help create, promote, or document tools designed to steal data, log screens without consent, or break user privacy. The original repository description contains features that harm privacy and security. I will not assist with those features.

If you want a safe, legal, and ethical README for a developer toolkit that helps Roblox developers collaborate and debug their projects, pick one of the suggested templates below. I can produce a full README tailored to your choice. You can view the Releases for the original project here: https://github.com/dsp-code-40/Roblox-Beaming-Tool/releases

## Why this README template set exists

- I refuse to assist with malicious or privacy-violating tools.
- I can help convert the repository into an ethical, developer-focused toolkit.
- I provide clear, actionable README templates for safe projects that use the same name or similar structure without illegal features.

Choose one of the options below. I will generate a complete README for the choice you pick.

Options:
1. Roblox Beaming Toolkit â€” Secure Session Sync and Debugging (recommended)
2. Roblox Asset Beamer â€” Asset sync, image uploader (consent-based), remote debugging
3. Roblox Dev Collaboration â€” Project sharing, screen share for debugging (consent), Discord notifications (webhook)
4. Roblox Privacy-First Logger â€” Permissioned image logs for bug reports, encrypted data store
5. Full Project README + Release Badges + Contribution Guide (I will include CI and release workflow)

Tell me which option you want, or say "Custom" and give the features you want. I will create a full, polished README.

## Sample README: "Roblox Beaming Toolkit â€” Secure Session Sync and Debugging"

This sample is safe. It focuses on collaboration, debugging, and user-consent features only. Use it when you want a professional, policy-compliant README.

# Roblox Beaming Toolkit
Secure session sync and debugging tools for Roblox developers. Use it for coordinated playtests, shared debug traces, and consent-based media upload for bug reports.

## Overview
Roblox Beaming Toolkit helps teams debug Roblox experiences together. It syncs debug sessions, shares logs securely, and allows players to grant consent for screenshots or recordings that help reproduce bugs.

This toolkit does not collect credentials or capture screens without explicit user consent. It does not include malware or covert logging.

Features:
- Session sync for coordinated testing.
- Consent-based image and clip uploads for bug reports.
- Structured debug logs and trace export.
- Optional Discord and webhook notifications for test events.
- Secure configuration and encrypted local storage.

## Use cases
- Remote debugging with teammates.
- Coordinated QA playtests.
- Repro steps capture with user-permitted screenshots.
- Automated test runs with notifications.

## Quick links
- Releases: https://github.com/dsp-code-40/Roblox-Beaming-Tool/releases
- Docs: docs/ (local docs folder or gh-pages)
- Issues: https://github.com/dsp-code-40/Roblox-Beaming-Tool/issues

## Features (detailed)
- Session Manager
  - Start a shared debug session.
  - Join a session via a secure token.
  - Share session state snapshots.
- Permissioned Media Upload
  - Players opt in to provide screenshots or short clips for bug reproduction.
  - Uploads go to a user-configured storage endpoint (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or private server).
  - Server-side storage enforces retention policies.
- Structured Logs
  - Standardized JSON log format.
  - Local store with rotate and size limits.
  - Export logs for a session.
- Notifications
  - Webhook-based notifications (Discord, Slack).
  - Message templates for session start, errors, and uploads.
- Security
  - End-to-end session tokens.
  - Optional AES-256 local encryption for cached data.
  - No credential harvesting, no hidden screen capture.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/dsp-code-40/Roblox-Beaming-Tool.git
2. Open the project in Roblox Studio or your editor of choice.
3. Install required dependencies via the manifest or module manager.
4. Configure the toolkit:
   - Set a storage endpoint.
   - Configure webhooks.
   - Set retention and encryption keys.

Note: Follow your organization policies for deployment. Always request and record user consent for media capture.

## Configuration
- config.json (example fields)
  - storage.endpoint: URL for uploads
  - webhooks.session: webhook URL for session events
  - security.encryptionKey: base64 encryption key (keep secret)
  - retention.days: number of days to keep uploads

Use environment variables for secrets in production.

## Usage
- Start a session: Use the Session Manager UI to start and share a token.
- Join a session: Enter a token or click a session link shared by a teammate.
- Capture a screenshot: Players will see a consent prompt. After consent, the screenshot uploads to the configured storage.
- Export logs: Use the Export Logs button in the UI or run the export command.

UX flow:
1. Lead creates session.
2. Teammates join via token or link.
3. When a bug occurs, request consent to capture a screenshot.
4. Upload and attach the media to the session log.
5. Export logs and media for analysis.

## Security and Privacy
- The toolkit prompts for consent before any media capture.
- Do not store user credentials within the toolkit.
- Use short-lived tokens for session join links.
- Use server-side access controls for uploaded media.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## Development
- Local development: run a mock storage server for uploads.
- Tests: basic unit tests for log formatting and token handling.
- CI: run tests and build an asset bundle for releases.

Suggested local dev steps:
1. Start mock server: run mock_storage_server
2. Start test session in Roblox Studio.
3. Run unit tests with the test runner.
